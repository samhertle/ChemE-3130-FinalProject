#### Background
The Lake Source Cooling project is speculating adding an additional heat pump to their system in order to eliminate the use of chillers in their system. We analyzed the change in COP for using mutliple refrigerants, a single and double loop using the code in the optimization. It utilizes information from Steve Beyers about the current LSC system and also what they hope to achieve with the additional cooling system (*smb75@cornell.edu*).
